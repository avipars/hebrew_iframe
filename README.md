# LearnHebrew Translate

Live site: https://avipars.github.io/hebrew_iframe/index.html

Split screen view of Morfix and Reverso Context using iFrames. There is a unified search bar that will update both sites at the same time. 

This allows you to compare results and varying translation quality between the two platforms.
