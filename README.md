# LearnHebrew Translate

Live site: https://avipars.github.io/hebrew_iframe/index.html

Split screen view of Morfix and Reverso Context using iFrames. There is a unified search bar that will update both sites at the same time. 

This allows you to compare results and varying translation quality between the two platforms. 
Feel free to open an issue and make a pull request with new features.
